* Semantic Similarity Measurement by Jointly Embedding of Knowledge Graph and Words

This research project proposes a method to enhance the semantic similarity judgment on graphs through joint embdding text information. There are rich hierarchical information among the concept nodes of knowledge graph. This project embeds the graph nodes and words jointly into the Poincar√© space that can express hierarchical information better.
